# AQI Comparison Between Chennai, Kolkata, and Vishakapatnam

## Project Overview
This project analyzes and compares the **Air Quality Index (AQI)** of three major **port cities in India**: **Chennai, Kolkata, and Vishakapatnam**. Since these cities have significant industrial and maritime activities, monitoring air pollution levels is crucial for understanding environmental and health impacts.

## Features of the Project
- **Data Analysis on AQI Trends:** Monthly AQI variations for each city.
- **Comparison Between Cities:** Identifies pollution peaks and variations.
- **Seasonal AQI Trends:** Effect of different seasons on air pollution.
- **Impact of Maritime Activities:** Analysis of AQI based on the presence of different types of ships (Oil, Iron Ore, Coal, POL, Fertilizer).
- **Interactive Power BI Dashboard:** Visual representation of insights.

## Key Insights and Decisions
1. **Kolkata Experiences the Highest AQI Spikes:**
   - Peak AQI in **March (339.06)**, likely due to **increased industrial activity and temperature rise**.
   - Maximum AQI recorded at **424**, indicating severe pollution at times.
   - **Decision:** Implement stricter air pollution controls in industrial zones.

2. **Vishakapatnam Peaks in June (227.00):**
   - Likely due to **monsoon humidity trapping pollutants** and **maritime activities**.
   - **Decision:** Encourage cleaner fuel use in shipping and industrial areas.

3. **Chennai Has the Lowest AQI Among the Three:**
   - Average AQI **153.17**, with a peak of **231**.
   - **Decision:** Maintain current pollution control measures while monitoring seasonal variations.

4. **Industrial and Shipping Activities Impact AQI:**
   - Ports handling **coal, oil, and fertilizers** show higher pollution levels.
   - **Decision:** Improve emission standards and monitoring systems in port regions.

## Impact of This Project
âœ… **Environmental Awareness:** Helps policymakers understand air pollution trends in port cities.
âœ… **Improved Regulations:** Enables better decision-making for pollution control policies.
âœ… **Public Health Benefits:** Identifies periods of high pollution, allowing preventive health measures.
âœ… **Sustainable Development:** Encourages eco-friendly industrial and maritime practices.
